# Titanic survival prediction model
Using the 'train.csv' from the [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) Kaggle competition,
a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck will be created.

This will be done using PySpark on Google Colab. 

What will you find in this repo:
- Data cleaning and EDA
- Classifications algorithms considered
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Compare the best models
- Predict the survival of Titanic passengers

_Note: this was a collaborative task with three other peers in the international BABD master @ POLIMI General School of Management._
