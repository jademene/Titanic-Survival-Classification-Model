# Titanic survival prediction model
Using the 'train.csv' from the [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) Kaggle competition,
a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck will be created.

This will be done using PySpark on Google Colab.
